### Issues
- [#8750](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8750)
  - We attempted to work on this issue as a group and spent over a week trying fix it. However, we came to realize the issue was much more complicated than we had anticipated so we abandoned it. This realization came after the owner of zulip noticed we had been directed to the wrong files to edit the issue, and stated that the issue ran deeper than originally thought.  

- [#8837](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8837)
  - This issue was created by Nadira after determining that the fix to a previous issue was inadequate. She claimed this issue and has submitted a pull request for it.
  
- [#8547](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8547)
  - Adnan claimed this issue and has submitted a pull request for it.
  
- [#8144](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8144)
  - Ralphy claimed this issue and submitted a pull request. The pull request was closed due to it being "hacky."
  
- [#8473](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/8473)
  - We picked this issue as something we could all potentially work on together but ultimately we abandoned it because the issue itself is more open-ended and lacks direction.
  
- [#9093](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9093)
  - Natalie claimed this issue and has submitted a pull request for it.
  
- [#9159](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9159)
  - Emilio created this issue and was planning on fixing it but the issue was closed due to a misunderstanding regarding documentation. However, after further discussion with @timabbott (owner of zulip), a pull request was generated from this issue, focusing on a different part of the documentation. 
  
- [#9234](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9234)
  - Emilio opened this issue regarding outdated JavaScript guidelines in Zulip's documentation. He is waiting for feedback from the grand master @timabbott before working on this issue. Ideally this would lead to another PR in the documentation and also more PRs in refactoring old JS files that need to be updated to the ES6 standard.  
  
- [#9046](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/9046)
  - Emilio opened this issue, but it was actually a duplicate. He then spent time searching for a fix to this issue, but made no progress. Solving this problem required having a more intricate knowledge of how zulip was built than he possessed. The owner of zulip @timabbott had in mind a specific way he wanted this problem solved, and he eventually submitted a [PR](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/5ae9505fdce6c46a7d6cff9bd98f687173ba56b7) fix for the issue two and a half weeks after he opened as other contributors failed to offer a suitable fix.
